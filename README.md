# Freelance JavaScript Developer - Maria Szubski

**Hosted at https://mariaszubski.com**

Hi, I’m Maria and I work remotely as a **Freelance Front-End Developer** based in Cincinnati, OH. I specialize in **React**, **JAMStack**, and **Shopify**. I love to help small businesses launch their projects with user-friendly interfaces, maintainable code, and the latest best practices.

I've been a full-time contractor for over two years and have worked with **12 clients** on over **25 projects**. I’ve launched websites solo and have been embedded in teams on long-term contracts. I pick up development languages and technologies quickly and am comfortable hopping on new frameworks to best suit the client's needs.

Before freelancing, I spent 7 years as a **UX Designer** and **Developer** in the consumer retail, entertainment, sports, and B2B software industries. I volunteered with a non-profit for 3 years, organizing events and classes in the local tech community. I've led in-person workshops on topics like **GatsbyJS** and Intro to Web Development.

### Interested in working together?

I'm always looking for new clients! Whether you have a specific project in mind or your agency needs a part-time developer to handle project overflow, I’m happy to hear from you. Reach out at **hello@mariaszubski.com** or through **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariaszubski/)** to get the ball rolling.
