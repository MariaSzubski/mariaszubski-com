            <strong>Shopify</strong>. I love to help small businesses launch
            projects with the best practices in accessibility, user experience,
            and maintainable code standards.

          <p>
            Before freelancing, I spent 7 years as a{" "}
            <strong>UX Designer</strong> and <strong>Developer</strong> in the
            consumer retail, entertainment, sports, and B2B software industries.
            I volunteered with a tech non-profit for 3 years, organizing events
            and classes for the local chapter. I&#39;ve led in-person workshops
            on <strong>GatsbyJS</strong> and Intro to Web Development.
